# Human Activity Classification using 3D Kinect Data

In this project, I've designed and implemented a mathematical model for the classification of human activities using 3D Kinect data. An algorithm has been developed for the alignment of multi-dimensional time-series data based on the notions of Dynamic Time Warping and Wavelet Decomposition. A Random Decision Forest model has also been developed and utilized for classifying the transformed multi-dimensional data.

Please refer to the following paper for a recent review of the relevant literature:
